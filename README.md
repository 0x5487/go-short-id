# ShortId

Sometimes, we couldn't use GUID/UUID as primary key in our application.  In this case, we have to generate a short id to resovle the problem.  The package generates a short id which  is 12 characters.  For instance, `15DE398FEB83`.  The first two characters represent to current year, and characters which between 3 to 10 are random.  The last two characters are machineId.
